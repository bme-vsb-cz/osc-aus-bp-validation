# Technical validation of oscillometric blood pressure measurements

This repository contains MATLAB scripts used for data preprocessing and
technical validation of oscillometric (OSC) blood pressure measurements
against auscultatory (AUS) reference measurements.

The scripts were developed to support the analyses reported in the
accompanying scientific publication.

## Repository structure

- `dataProcessing_EN.m`  
  Data preprocessing and quality control pipeline.  
  Includes detection of physiologically implausible values, handling of
  missing data, translation of categorical variables, anonymization of
  personal identifiers, and generation of a cleaned dataset.

- `technicalValidation_EN.m`  
  Technical validation of OSC versus AUS measurements, including:
  - distribution analysis (boxplots),
  - correlation analysis (Pearson and Spearman),
  - Bland–Altman analysis,
  - intra-visit repeatability assessment.

## Input data

The scripts expect a cleaned and anonymized JSON dataset generated by the
preprocessing pipeline.  
Due to data protection regulations, the input data are **not included** in
this repository.

---

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2023b or newer
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

---

## Usage

1. Run `dataProcessing_EN.m` to preprocess raw data and generate a cleaned
   dataset in JSON format.
2. Run `technicalValidation_EN.m` to perform technical validation and
   generate figures and numerical summaries.

## Notes on data cleaning

The preprocessing pipeline employs a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop
approach for selected quality control steps. When potentially incorrect
records are detected, the user is prompted to manually decide whether to
remove or correct the record. This design was chosen to preserve clinically
plausible borderline measurements that cannot be reliably resolved using
fully automated rules.
